# Autisten.Info Website
## About
Autisten Informieren is a free and independent association of autistic people and / or relatives.
Our commitment serves the broader publicity and social education about autism and related neurodivergence, such as ADHD. We see ourselves as translators and mediators between the autistic person and their immediate environment and caregivers.
Our common goal is to achieve greater mutual understanding, tolerance and acceptance of each other's "slightly different way" of thinking, perception and view of their environment, their fellow human beings and themselves.
In this way, we provide first-hand information and our own authentic experience reports for our fellow sufferers, their relatives and people who are professionally involved with autism. 

This Github repository is the source code of our website. In an effort to maximize transparency and as part of the modernization of our online offerings, we will publish the entire website as a publicly accessible github repository. *This does not mean that any of the content is open source and can be used unlicensed. all content is the property and copyrighted work of Autisten Informieren and its respective authors*, unless otherwise noted.

## Technical Details
The Website is build with Nuxt 3 + Bootstrap 5. To be able to modify the website fast and easy, we use Bootstrap Studio for the Design and a custom Converter to convert the Bootstrap Studio HTML to Nuxt 3 Vue Components. The Website is hosted directly on Github Pages.
